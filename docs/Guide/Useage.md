# Drop-in Usage

`ezp` is designed to be a drop-in library.
However, the `master` branch contains other files that are needed for the project itself but not necessary to use.

A lean version can be found in the `lite-lib` branch.

One can clone the repository as a submodule via the following command.

```bash
git clone --recursive --branch lite-lib https://github.com/TLCFEM/ezp.git
```

This only contains necessary files to use the library.
